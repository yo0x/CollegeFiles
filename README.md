# [CollegeFiles](http://yonor.me/coollegefiles)

CollegeFiles is a simple python app which downloads all the course's files from a [MOODLE](https://moodle.org/) site and nicely organize them in their respective folder.
It's prety handy, as a student or lecturer, to keep an offline/update copy of your Courses with you all the time.

Code available on [github](https://github.com/yo0x/CollegeFiles)
